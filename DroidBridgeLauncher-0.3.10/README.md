## Important

DroidBridge Launcher is an independent Android project by **DNA Mobile Applications**.

DroidBridge Launcher is built for users who already own Minecraft: Java Edition and want to manage and launch their own local game installation on Android. The launcher does not include Minecraft game files, Minecraft assets, paid content, account tokens, or other proprietary Mojang/Microsoft files.

Minecraft, Mojang, Microsoft, Xbox, and related names, services, trademarks, and assets belong to their respective owners. Users are responsible for following the Minecraft EULA, Minecraft Usage Guidelines, Microsoft Services Agreement, and any other terms that apply to their account, game copy, device, mods, resource packs, servers, or third-party content.

Other than any limited authentication or API access granted for Microsoft account sign-in, DroidBridge Launcher is not affiliated with, sponsored by, endorsed by, partnered with, or approved as an official Minecraft product by Mojang, Microsoft, Xbox, Minecraft, PojavLauncher, Boardwalk, Zalith Launcher, Amethyst, Fold Craft Launcher, or any other third-party launcher project.

## About

DroidBridge Launcher is a launcher-side Android compatibility project. It helps users manage Minecraft: Java Edition versions, instances, runtime components, renderers, controls, mods, resource packs, shader packs, worlds, logs, and launcher settings on Android.

The project may use, modify, adapt, study, or interoperate with open-source launcher work where the applicable license allows it. DroidBridge Launcher keeps third-party license obligations attached to the code they apply to, including attribution, notice preservation, license text availability, and source availability where required.

## Microsoft account sign-in

DroidBridge Launcher may support Microsoft account sign-in through Microsoft identity services.

Microsoft account sign-in or related Minecraft service/API access may require review, registration, allow-listing, or approval from Microsoft, Mojang, or their service teams before it is available in a production build. If that access has been granted, it applies only to the authentication or API access that was reviewed and allowed.

That limited authentication/API approval does not make DroidBridge Launcher an official Minecraft product, official launcher, Mojang partner, Microsoft partner, Xbox partner, or endorsed Minecraft service.

Users must use their own Microsoft/Minecraft account and are responsible for following the terms that apply to that account.

## Installation and game setup

DroidBridge Launcher is intended to help users install and manage their own Minecraft: Java Edition game files on their device after they have signed in or otherwise provided access allowed by the official services and terms.

Code written by DNA Mobile Applications for user-facing setup, game installation guidance, account sign-in, launcher flow, or related screens is written to respect the GNU license obligations of any GNU-licensed code it partially uses, modifies, links with, or depends on. Where a file or feature is based on GPL/LGPL-covered code, DroidBridge Launcher treats the covered portions and modifications as remaining under the applicable GNU license terms.

DroidBridge Launcher does not grant a Minecraft license, bypass Minecraft ownership checks, distribute Minecraft, or replace the need for a legitimate copy of Minecraft: Java Edition.

## Legal pages

## Source availability and license boundaries

DroidBridge Launcher is a mixed-origin source tree.

Files written entirely by **DNA Mobile Applications** are owned by DNA Mobile Applications unless a file header, license file, or notice says otherwise.

Files copied from, modified from, derived from, or based on third-party projects remain under their original license terms. This includes any code or modifications covered by GPL, LGPL, Apache-2.0, MIT, BSD, or other open-source licenses.

If this repository includes GPL/LGPL-covered code, the corresponding covered source code and DroidBridge Launcher modifications to that covered code must remain available under the applicable GNU license terms.

Private production configuration, Microsoft application credentials, signing material, API keys, account-service configuration, and original DNA Mobile Applications service/client code may be excluded from the public repository when they are not copied from, modified from, linked in a way that requires publication, or derived from GPL/LGPL-covered code.

Any file copied from, modified from, or derived from GPL/LGPL-covered code remains subject to the applicable GPL/LGPL terms, regardless of where it appears in the project.

## Privacy

DroidBridge Launcher is designed around local launcher data.

Launcher settings, logs, worlds, mods, resource packs, shader packs, instances, and related files are intended to stay on the user's device unless the user chooses to export, share, upload, back up, or send them through another app or service.

See the [DroidBridge Launcher Privacy Policy](https://dnamobilegaming.com/privacy) for the full privacy policy.
